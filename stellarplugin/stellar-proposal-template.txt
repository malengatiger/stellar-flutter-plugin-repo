Project title: The Stokkie Network, a platform for Community Wallets and Financial Collaboration.

Summary: The Stokkie Network is a cloud based platform that enables groups of people to collaborate on anything that involves jointly purchasing or saving for something. In South Africa's black communities, groups of friends form a Stokvel which is a handshake agreement to help each other save for some significant item or an important event. The Stokkie Network was inspired by this concept and the implementation was both inspired and enabled by Stellar. The platform consists of a backend based currently on Firebase that manages the data around the network participants and supports a set of mobile apps (Android implemented with iOS to follow). Each participant of the Stokkie Network acquires a Stellar account and each Stokvel (community based organization) similarly has a Stellar account. The group's collaborate around transactions that involve paying into the group's Stokvel account and subsequently spending the balance of the group account on some agreed item or event  üé≤
